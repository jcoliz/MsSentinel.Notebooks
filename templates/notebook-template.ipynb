    "> \"I want to analyze failed sign-in attempts from the SigninLogs table over the last 30 days. Calculate the number of failed attempts per user, identify patterns by time of day and location, and flag users with more than 10 failed attempts from different IP addresses.

    "\n",
    "Follow this three-phase approach with your AI assistant:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 1: Design** 📋\n",
    "1. Ask your AI assistant: *\"Based on my description above, create a detailed design document for this notebook.\"*\n",
    "2. Review the design for:\n",
    "   - Data sources and table schemas\n",
    "   - Analysis methodology\n",
    "   - Output schema\n",
    "   - Edge cases and limitations\n",
    "3. Iterate: Provide feedback and refine the design until you're satisfied\n",
    "4. Save the final design in a `DESIGN.md` file\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 2: Implementation Plan** 🗺️\n",
    "1. Ask your AI assistant: *\"Create a step-by-step implementation plan with specific cell-by-cell instructions.\"*\n",
    "2. Review the plan for:\n",
    "   - Logical flow and structure\n",
    "   - Required libraries and imports\n",
    "   - Error handling strategies\n",
    "   - Testing approach\n",
    "3. Iterate: Adjust the plan based on your environment and requirements\n",
    "4. Save the final plan in an `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 3: Cell-by-Cell Implementation** 💻\n",
    "1. Ask your AI assistant: *\"Create the first cell according to the implementation plan.\"*\n",
    "2. Review and test each cell:\n",
    "   - Run the cell and verify the output\n",
    "   - Check for errors or unexpected results\n",
    "   - Validate data quality and transformations\n",
    "3. Iterate: If a cell doesn't work as expected:\n",
    "   - Share the error message with your AI assistant\n",
    "   - Describe what you expected vs. what happened\n",
    "   - Ask for corrections or alternative approaches\n",
    "4. Move to the next cell only after the current cell works correctly\n",
    "5. Repeat until the notebook is complete\n",

    "## 💡 Tips for Working with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be Specific:**\n",
    "- Provide exact table names and column names\n",
    "- Specify date ranges and time windows\n",
    "- Define thresholds and scoring criteria clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterate Incrementally:**\n",
    "- Test each cell before moving to the next\n",
    "- Don't try to build the entire notebook at once\n",
    "- Validate intermediate results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Share Context:**\n",
    "- Show error messages in full\n",
    "- Describe your data characteristics (volume, freshness, etc.)\n",
    "- Explain your security objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask Questions:**\n",
    "- \"Why did you choose this approach?\"\n",
    "- \"What are the performance implications?\"\n",
    "- \"How can I optimize this query?\"\n",
    "- \"What edge cases should I consider?\"\n",
