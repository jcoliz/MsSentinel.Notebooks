# Project Conventions

This document captures project-specific conventions and rules for this repository.

## Commit Message Convention

When completing tasks that modify repository files, always include a conventional commit message in the task completion readout.

**Requirements**:
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
- Keep under 100 words
- Include type prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, etc.
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer when applicable

**Example**:
```
feat: add notebook sanitization script

Implement sanitize-notebook.py to remove outputs and replace credentials with placeholders. Includes dry-run mode and validation checks for required documentation files.

Prevents accidental commits of sensitive data.
```

**Why**: Provides immediate, standardized commit messages for direct use, improving git history quality and making changes easy to understand.

## Documentation Structure

- User-facing documentation goes in `docs/`
- Work-in-progress planning and design documents go in `docs/wip/`
- Each notebook requires three documentation files: README.md, DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md

## Workspace vs Published Notebooks

- **workspace/**: Private development area, gitignored, contains real credentials
- **notebooks/**: Public published area, sanitized, no outputs or credentials
- Always sanitize notebooks before publishing from workspace to notebooks

## Category Organization

- Categories created organically as notebooks are added
- Don't create empty category directories
- Suggested categories: threat-hunting, incident-response, reporting, data-exploration, automation

## Configuration Management

- All configuration must be inline in notebooks (no external config files)
- Use template placeholders: `WORKSPACE_NAME = "<YOUR_WORKSPACE_NAME>"`
- Sanitization script handles placeholder replacement

## Script Implementation Priority

1. Phase 1: `sanitize-notebook.py` (critical for security)
2. Phase 2: `setup-workspace.py` (developer convenience)
3. Phase 4: `validate-notebooks.py` (CI/CD integration)
